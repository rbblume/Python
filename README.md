# Python This section contains Python samples we coded during our course achievements. Python progamming centered around Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis. We looked at the sales patters by location, by product type, time of day, income, family size, and product price to gain insights into the type of customers being served and how to increase sales at certain times. We focused on brand loyalty, customer loyalty including developing customer loyalty flags, income flags, and habits by customer location, family size, and income. Data was imported into a panda dataframe then data types and identifiers were renamed and data dictionarys reviewed. Data consistentency was checked and data was cleaned. Many data sets were merged and saved as pickel files. Grouping, aggregating, and visualization was performed on the data set with a final report with visualizes to suggest insights for advertising and other targeted analysis.


You can see the project brief, and the organization of the analysis done step by step along with the original data and the output file for the end project.
